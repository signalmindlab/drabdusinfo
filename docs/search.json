    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete."

    "text": "If you have ever tried converting a PDF full of mathematical equations to Word, you know the pain. Standard converters butcher formulas, turn integrals into gibberish, and somehow transform your carefully formatted thesis into a mess. That is where Mathpix changes everything.\nAfter converting hundreds of academic papers and technical documents, I can tell you Mathpix is hands-down the best tool when you are dealing with complex math.\nThe difference? Mathpix uses AI trained specifically on mathematical notation. While Adobe Acrobat might be okay for text-heavy documents, Mathpix actually understands what complex integrals and equations mean."

If you are converting regularly, their paid plans start at $4.99/month for unlimited conversions. Honestly worth it if you are a grad student or researcher.\n\n\nConfigure Your Settings (This Matters!)\nBefore you start converting, spend two minutes setting this up right. Trust me, it will save you headaches later.\nOpen Mathpix Snip settings and tweak these:\n\nDefault format: Set it to Microsoft Word (.docx)\nEquation format: I usually go with “Microsoft Word Equations” since most people use Word. Pick “LaTeX” if that is your thing.\nImage handling: Bump the DPI to 300 or higher. Low-res images = bad equation recognition.\nTable recognition: Turn this on. Tables are tricky enough without fighting the software.\n\n\n\nHow to Actually Convert Your PDF\nThere are two ways to do this, depending on your situation:\n\nThe Quick Way (Screen Capture)\nThis is what I use 90% of the time:\n\nOpen your PDF in any viewer (Adobe, Preview, whatever)\nHit the Mathpix hotkey (Ctrl+Cmd+M on Mac, Ctrl+Alt+M on Windows)\nSelect the part you want to convert - can be a paragraph, an equation, or a whole page\nMathpix does its magic:\n\nGrabs all the text\nConverts equations perfectly\nKeeps formatting intact\n\nClick “Export” and choose Word (.docx)\n\nDone. Takes like 5 seconds per section.\n\n\nBatch Processing (If You Paid for It)\nGot a 50-page paper? The paid version lets you batch process:\n\nFile → Import PDF\nPick your PDF\nSelect which pages you want (or just do the whole thing)\nHit “Convert to DOCX”\nWait a bit - usually 10-30 seconds per page depending on complexity\n\nThen grab coffee while it works.\n\n\n\nDo Not Skip This Step: Review Your Work\nLook, Mathpix is good but it is not perfect. Always check your output before calling it done:\n\nOpen that Word doc and skim through it\nPay special attention to:\n\nSubscripts and superscripts (these sometimes get wonky)\nGreek letters and special symbols\nFraction bars and integral signs\nMatrix brackets and how things align\n\nCheck your tables - they are usually the first thing to break\nFix any formatting weirdness\n\nI usually catch 1-2 small errors per page, mostly in really complex nested equations. Way better than manually retyping everything though."

    "text": "Tips That Will Save You Time\n\nStart with a Good PDF\nGarbage in, garbage out. If your PDF is a blurry scan from a 1990s copier, even Mathpix cannot work miracles.\nWhat you need:\n\nQuality source: High-res PDF, not a crappy scan\nResolution: At least 150 DPI, but 300+ is way better\nNo restrictions: Some PDFs have security settings that block OCR - remove those first\nCorrect orientation: Make sure pages are not sideways (sounds obvious, but you would be surprised)\n\n\n\nGetting Equations Right\nHere is what works from my experience:\nWhat Mathpix handles like a boss:\n\nFractions and radicals: a/b, √x\nIntegrals and summations: ∫₀^∞, Σᵢ₌₁ⁿ\nMatrices (properly formatted with brackets)\nAll the Greek letters: α, β, γ, Δ, you name it\nSubscripts/superscripts: xᵢ², e^(-αt)\nFunctions: sin, cos, log, lim\n\nPro tips:\n\nTyped equations &gt; handwritten (though Mathpix handles both)\nFor super complex equations, break them into smaller chunks\nDouble-check Greek letters - sometimes ν (nu) becomes v\nMulti-line equations need a quick review for alignment\n\n\n\nHandling Big Documents\nConverting a whole thesis? Here is my workflow:\n\nGo page by page for anything important - it is more accurate\nCheck your section breaks and headings\nVerify references did not get scrambled\nLook at figure captions - numbering sometimes gets messed up\nTables are finicky - these need the most attention\n\nMixed content strategy:\n\nRegular text sections: Convert in bigger blocks\nHeavy equation sections: Take it slower, check carefully\nDiagrams and figures: Sometimes it is easier to just re-insert these manually\n\n\n\nAfter You Convert\nDo not just export and forget. I use this checklist:\n\nQuick scan - catch obvious problems\nEquation check - compare each one to the original\nFormatting pass - make everything consistent with Word styles\nReferences - make sure citations are all there\nFinal read - catch any OCR weirdness"

Consider keeping them as images\nOr just rebuild them in Word - sometimes that is faster\n\n\n\nFormatting Is Weird\nYeah, formatting can get wonky:\n\nTry exporting with minimal formatting, then apply Word styles yourself\nLook for formatting templates in Mathpix settings\nConvert sections individually to figure out where the problem is\nDo a find-and-replace for extra spaces and line breaks\n\n\n\nMissing Special Characters\nAnnoying but fixable:\n\nCheck your Unicode settings in export options\nMake sure you have the right fonts installed in Word\nUse Word’s equation editor for mathematical symbols\nConsider LaTeX export if symbols keep disappearing"

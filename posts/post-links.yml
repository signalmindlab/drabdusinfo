#   title: "The Korean Parking Fine Hack: How to Get a Warning Text Before the Ticket"
#   author: "Md Abdus Samad"
#   description: "In South Korea, drivers can legally receive a warning text message before an illegal parking fine is issued, offering a 5-10 minute grace period to move the vehicle and avoid the penalty (typically 40,000 KRW). The system's advantages are avoiding fines and encouraging voluntary compliance. How to get the alerts: Register with Whistle (010car.kr) for nationwide coverage. Alternatively, register directly with your local government's parking alert system. Critical Exceptions (Where you get an immediate fine): Warnings do not apply in high-risk zones like School Zones, near Fire Hydrants, on Crosswalks, or when a violation is reported by a citizen using the Safety e-Report App."

Master the art of creating anonymized manuscripts for peer review using LaTeX conditional statements. One source file, two versions — streamline your academic submission workflow with elegant toggle mechanisms.

---

## The Toggle Mechanism

The anonymization system uses a simple boolean toggle that controls what content appears in your final PDF:

```latex
\documentclass[preprint,12pt]{elsarticle}

% === Toggle for anonymized version ===
\newif\ifanon
\anonfalse     % Produces title page with author info
% \anontrue    % Produces anonymized manuscript
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Key Concept
By commenting/uncommenting just one line (`\anonfalse` or `\anontrue`), you can switch between complete author information and fully anonymized versions.
:::

---

## Document Structure Overview

```latex
\begin{document}
\begin{frontmatter}

\title{An Example Paper Title}

\ifanon
    % --- Anonymized: no authors ---
\else
    % --- Full title page ---
    \author[1]{Alice Smith}
    \author[2]{Bob Johnson}
    \address[1]{Department of Physics, University A, City, Country}
    \address[2]{Department of Mathematics, University B, City, Country}
    \cortext[cor1]{Corresponding author}
    \ead{alice.smith@university.edu}
\fi

\begin{abstract}
This is the abstract placeholder.
\end{abstract}

\begin{keyword}
Keyword1 \sep Keyword2 \sep Keyword3
\end{keyword}

\end{frontmatter}
```

## How the Toggle Works

| Version | Toggle Setting | What Appears |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Full Author Version | `\anonfalse` | Authors, Affiliations, Email, Abstract, Keywords |
| Anonymized Version | `\anontrue` | Abstract, Keywords only (authors hidden) |

---

## Main Content Sections

The example also shows how to conditionally include main content sections:

```latex
% === Main manuscript sections ===
\ifanon

\section{Introduction}
This is the introduction text.

\section{Methods}
Methodology details here.

\section{Results}
Results go here.

\section{Discussion}
Discussion text here.

\fi
```

::: {.callout-warning}
## Note
In this example, the main sections only appear in the anonymized version. You might want to modify this logic based on your specific submission requirements.
:::

---

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Set up the toggle

Add the toggle mechanism at the top of your document:

```latex
\newif\ifanon
\anonfalse  % Change to \anontrue for anonymous version
```

### Step 2: Conditional author information

Wrap author details in the conditional block:

```latex
\ifanon
    % Leave empty or add placeholder
\else
    \author[1]{Your Name}
    \address[1]{Your Institution}
    \ead{your.email@institution.edu}
\fi
```

### Step 3: Switch versions

To create an anonymized version:

- Change `\anonfalse` to `\anontrue`
- Recompile your LaTeX document
- The PDF will now exclude all author information

## Advanced Anonymization Techniques

### Conditional Text in Body

```latex
In our previous work \ifanon [Reference Hidden] \else \citep{Smith2023} \fi, we demonstrated...
```

### Conditional Acknowledgments

```latex
\ifanon
    % No acknowledgments in anonymous version
\else
    \section*{Acknowledgments}
    We thank our colleagues for their valuable feedback.
\fi
```

### Conditional Funding Information

```latex
\ifanon
    % No funding info in anonymous version
\else
    \section*{Funding}
    This work was supported by Grant XYZ-123.
\fi
```

---

## Best Practices

### Test Both Versions

Always compile and review both anonymized and full versions before submission to catch any formatting issues.

### Remove Identifying Citations

Consider hiding self-citations in the anonymized version to maintain reviewer blindness.

### Check Acknowledgments

Funding and acknowledgment sections often reveal author identity and should be conditionally hidden.

### Review Figures

Ensure figure captions do not contain identifying information like institutional logos or names.

### Institutional References

Be careful about references to "our institution" or similar identifying language in the text.

### Contact Information

Double-check that email addresses and phone numbers are properly hidden in anonymous mode.

## Quick Reference Summary

::: {.callout-note}
## Summary

- Use `\newif\ifanon` to create a boolean toggle for anonymization
- Set `\anonfalse` for full author version, `\anontrue` for anonymous
- Wrap author information in `\ifanon...\else...\fi` blocks
- Single source file produces both submission versions
- Always test both versions before submitting to journals
- Consider additional identifying content beyond just author names
- Use conditional blocks for acknowledgments, funding, and self-citations
- Review all content that might reveal author identity

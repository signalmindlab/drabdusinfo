:::{#hero-heading}

I am a Research Professor in the Department of Information and Communication Engineering at Yeungnam University, South Korea, specializing in signal processing, deep learning, and explainable AI with applications in wireless networks, medical imaging, IoT sensor networks, and intelligent systems. I am a registered Korean Researcher and active IEEE member. My research addresses challenges in next-generation wireless communications, including millimeter-wave propagation, atmospheric interference, and signal quality optimization, while exploring how artificial intelligence and machine learning can enhance wireless system performance, network optimization, and propagation prediction. I have published over 60 papers in SCIE and SSCI-indexed journals and serve as a peer reviewer for multiple Web of Science-indexed journals. 

Previously, I served as Assistant Professor in the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at International Islamic University Chittagong (2013–2017), where I contributed to curriculum development and mentored future telecommunications engineers. I earned my Ph.D. in Information and Communication Engineering from Chosun University, fully supported by the Korean Government Scholarship (Global Korea Scholarship) and funded by the National Research Foundation of Korea.
